Description: -  I tried to make a clone of the Maggi landing page with all the effects shown on the webpage. And it is fully responsible for using media queries. 
                tools I used:- to make the webpage is 1] Telwind css framework 2]font away some for icons 3]color imported to plugins to tailwind config js.
                there are some fixed div also there that can be fixed by using a parent relative position. 

                
Making:-       * First section 
                 first of all, I tried to make a clone of the first background image with full-screen width h with 80%. on that bg image, I make a div with 
                consist of  heading input an unordered list, and a button.
                 there is also a main tag where I make a max-width of 100 % for full screen.
               * Second section 
                 Restaurant menu with heading
                 there is a div consisting of three div in it that a div will consist of image heading and icons.
               * thirst section 
                 Maggi cup image 
                 where there is one div with a width of 100% and inside two div with left and right with 50 50% width to both 
                 the left side consists of an image and another will be the heading paragraph and button 
               * fourth  section  
                 where there is a full image of the screen size on that there is a div that consists of heading paragraphs and a button
               * fifth section
                where the same as the above third section is only there I want to explain about button transition where I make
                a  button tag inside it I make a span tag where the button tag will be relative and the span tag will be absolute.
                then for the button, its bg will be brown and after hovering the traction on the span of transforms will move to 100% 
                and it will cover with yellow color .
               *footer tag 
                here I make 3 separate sections fixed div one is whatsup app  another is the privacy setting and last our feedback section.
                where all the div will be absolute with the parent footer consist relative positions.
                there WhatsUp tag consists of two div outer is fixed with some position and the inner is fixed position.
                all others with the same.
               *last navbar section
               where there are two navbars one for the top right of the screen for full width and another for is bottom of the screen for Andriod.
                It is hidden and shown using media queries.
